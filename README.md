# Demonizer

Demonizer will allow you to implement your demo application by jumping directly to the flesh by creating a console shell for you that will make the interaction more friendly.

All you have to do is implement, for each of your demos, a class that inherits from `IDemo` and install the tool via `Demonizer.Run()` at the entry point of your console application.
